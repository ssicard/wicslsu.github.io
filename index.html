      <div class="aboutContent">
        <div class="aboutItem"><h3>48 hours</h3><p>The Women in Computer Science Game Jam is an event that takes place from <b>Friday, November 6th at 5PM to Sunday, November 8th at 6PM.</b> You have 48 hours to create a video game, and like most game jams, this means staying overnight (or as late as you can!) to finish your game. Game jams are <b>intense, exciting, and a ton of fun!</b></p></div>
        <div class="aboutItem"><h3>create video games</h3><p>You can create <b>any kind of game you want,</b> and we're going to announce a <b>theme</b> the day of the event to provide inspiration. WICS wants to help you earn game development, team dynamic, and project <b>experience</b> from this event. You <b>do not need game development experience</b>, but experience in coding, art, or music helps! We recommend you use GameMaker if you don't already have experience in any relevant skills. There will also be <b>tutorials on fast game development</b> provided the day of the event.</p></div>
        <div class="aboutItem"><h3>who can participate</h3><p>This event is hosted by Women in Computer Science at LSU, but <b>students of any gender</b> can participate. You can come <b>with or without a team</b>- we'll match you up with people if you don't have one already! We also need <b>volunteers</b> to help out the day of the event. Register below if you're interested in participating or volunteering!</p></div></div>
